# db-viewer-component

Implementation of DB viewer web component.

To run (to see an example):
  1. npm i
  2. npm build-dev
  3. npm start
  4. In chrome browser navigate to http://localhost:9998

This project works on chrome and safari browsers right now. In Firefox there are some bugs.
It doesn't work in Edge browser, since edge doesn't have native support for web component.
